# Built in forces

The demo application comes with several built-in forces that can be used in your application config. This category explains what each force does and links references to learn more about them.

To learn how to define forces in your config, see [Particle interactions](/particle-interactions). To better understand
the types of forces Particles supports, see the developer docs on [Force types](/force-types).
