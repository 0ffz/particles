# About

Particles is a tool to run particle force simulations on the GPU. Our demo project provides some examples that simulate atomic interactions, however developers can write their own custom interactions using our API.

This project is built on the [Kool engine](https://github.com/kool-engine/kool), which lets us write GPU code for desktop and browser platforms, allowing less technical users to run prebuilt demos easily without the need for special hardware like an external graphics card.

Try the online demo, with instructions available on the [](Installation.md) page.
