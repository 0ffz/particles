# About

This project is designed to run both as a standalone application or as an API to implement custom forces on top of.
These docs are split into two parts, how to set up a project and create custom forces, and how to configure and use the compiled application.

The goal of this split is to allow less technical user to download a runnable application and configure it live without needing an IDE.
